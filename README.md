# Design-a-self-driving-car-solution-using-Reinforcement-Learning-using-Gym-Environment
We are the Team of 5 students from different state of India, applied for the internship with leadingindia.ai, an initiative from the Bennet University.
The internship period was of 6 weeks, started from 11th may 2020, and ended at 19th june 2020.
This project was given to us as a part of internship. We would like to thank leadingindia.ai for giving us an opportunity. 
It was a wonder experience and would recommend evreyone to take part in the events organised by leadingindia.ai.
We were being mentored by Dr. Hirenkumar B Thakkar sir throughout this internship.
The team members are as follows: 
Rushi Kanjaria from Marwadi University; 
Kala Hemanth from Aditya Engineering College; 
K. Jhansi Naga Indusri from V R Siddhartha engineering college; 
Apoorva Jindal from Techno India NJR Institute of Technology; 
Nagasuri Alekhya from R.V.R & J.C College Of Engineering; 
 In this project We are creating a simulation of a self driving car using the reinforcement learning and using the gym environment. we will be initiating the "Taxi-v3" environment from OpenAi gym. We will apply two methods to solve this environment and then compare the performance of both the methods. We have used Google Colab to implement train and test these methods.
